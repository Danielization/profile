						<!-- Stock trading -->
							<article id="trade">
								<h2 class="major">Algorithm Trader</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="static/images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My favorite part as a programmer is Algorithmic Trading. I am an experience trader with technical analysis
								and coding skills. Besides Python and C++, I'm also using <a href="https://www.mql5.com/en/users/danieliz">MQL5</a> to code tons of strategies
								and analysis stock market.</p>
								<p>My philosophy in trading is:<br>
								1) Trust NO one but the GRAPH only. Too many FAKE news out there, only GARPH will tell you the true story in the market.<br>
								2) If ever someone promised you that you can earn more than 50% every year by using his / her strategies, RUN! Even if they proof to you with the
								backtest "evidence" and their "awesome" backtest graph, don't fall for it, because even the professional traders in the Wall Street can't
								do that yearly.<br>
								3) Is NOT how much your strategy can be earned in the past, is how well your ability to control your risk. You will never know what is going to
								happen tomorrow, the past will not tell you the future, it only can teach you a lesson.</p>
								<p>All of the strategy is uniquely designed by me, and my team based on our observation. We believe, if one of the strategies is widely used by
									majority, then the gap for the profitability has become smaller and smaller, therefore, we need new ideas every single day to search for the
									alpha.</p>
